If CSIL is used for performance assessment instead of Expanse, make sure you evaluate when such a machine is lightly 
loaded using “uptime”. Please  indicate your evaluation is done on CSIL and list the uptime index of that CSIL machine.

1. How is the code parallelized? Show your solution by listing the key computation parallelized with
  OpenMP and related code.

2. Parallel time/speedup/efficiency using 2 and 4 cores under different scheduling/mapping methods
    for a full matrix (n=4096 and t=1024) on Expanse.

3. Parallel time/speedup/efficiency using 2 and 4 cores under different scheduling/mapping methods
 for an upper triangular matrix (n=4096 and t=1024) on Expanse.
Explain  the above significant performance differences of the above methods with a short reason.
